 In this project a Genetic Algorithm (GA) was designed and implemented in order to determine the bacterial growth in response to antibiotic resistance, based on the permeability of the bacteria membrane. The GA was designed using Python Programming Language. Bacterial growth was conducted by cloning bacteria in an environment that simulates the presence of an antibiotic. The simulation results show that the biological principles of bacteria and their antibiotic resistance mechanism were correctly designed and implemented.
Our code was based on the code available at:
